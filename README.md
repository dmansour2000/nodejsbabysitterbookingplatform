# Babysitter Booking Platform Web App

The Frontend is built using React.js and the backend is built using Node.js and MongoDB database. 
• It is a work in progress though as I will later on add ratings and reviews to babysitters by users on the app. 
• Also the ability for babysitters to upload thier personal photos on thier currently existing edit profile. 
• I will later on connect the web APIs on this web app to a new mobile app (Android and iOS)

## Available Scripts

In the (frontend) project directory, you can run:

### `npm run serve`

Launches the web app on http://localhost:5170 .<br />


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
