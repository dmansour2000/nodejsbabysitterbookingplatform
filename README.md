# Babysitter Booking Platform Web App

The Frontend is built using React.js and the backend is built using Node.js and MongoDB database. 
• It is a work in progress though as I will later on add ratings and reviews to babysitters by users on the app. 
• Also the ability for babysitters to upload thier personal photos on thier currently existing edit profile. 
• I will later on connect the web APIs on this web app to a new mobile app (Android and iOS)

## Available Scripts

In the (frontend) project directory, you can run:

### `npm run serve`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
